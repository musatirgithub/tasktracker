### Project Information

- Task tracker App's backend is coded with Django,

I used;

- Django
- Django rest framework
- Django-rest-auth
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Fetch Method (for all CRUD operations)
- Python anywhere

## Lesson Learned

- Converting between django - javascript datetime and local - UTC datetime was challenging. I've used react-datetime-picker in order to convert datetime structure. And had to write some javascript code. I'm not sure if I've used the best practice. So I will try to find out what kind of approach do professionals use.
